        Boneless, skinless chicken breasts: You can either purchased fresh (my preference) or frozen (which you will need to completely thaw before using).
        Some chicken also comes pre-brined nowadays, in which case you can skip step one below.
        Butter or olive oil: Your pick!  I like the extra flavor of butter, but olive oil will also work well.
        Kosher Salt: An essential ingredient in our brine, and also to season the chicken.
        Seasonings: I included an all-purpose blend of smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt and black pepper in the recipe below,
        which is super-simple and goes with just about anything.  But feel free to sub in any dry seasoning blend that you prefer.

        HOW DO YOU MAKE MONGOLIAN BEEF?
        This recipe starts with flank steak, which is thinly sliced then tossed in a little cornstarch.
        The meat is seared in a hot pan until a crispy coating is formed. While the meat is cooking, it’s time to make the sauce which consists of soy sauce,
        sesame oil, garlic, ginger and brown sugar. The steak is tossed in the sauce along with a handful of green onions, then you’re ready to eat.

        HOMEMADE SUSHI: TIPS, TRICKS, AND TOPPINGS
        Let’s dive right in!  It may seem like a lot to buy at first, but most of the ingredients turn into staples [like sriracha + sesame seeds] and
        non perishables like nori, sushi rice, and vinegar will last a ridiculously long time in your pantry.  You’ll end up with 4-6 sushi dinners for the price
        of one at a restaurant.  But above all else, it’s really fun!  Invite a few friends over and go nuts.
        As a bonus, this is one of the few times it’s socially acceptable to say “Here’s everything you need, now make your own dinner!”  Set out all your
        ingredients and let your friends & family create their own rolls!
        I’ll walk you through each step in the post and then include a printable cheat sheet at the end to make your new sushi adventure even easier!
